## Installation

_Download the development version with latest features_:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("business-science/timetk")
```

_Or, download CRAN approved version_:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

```


## Getting Started

- [Full Time Series Machine Learning and Feature Engineering Tutorial:](https://www.business-science.io/time-series/2020/03/18/time-series-machine-learning.html) Showcases the (NEW) `step_timeseries_signature()` for building ___200+ time series features___ using `parsnip`, `recipes`, and `workflows`. 

- [Visit the timetk website documentation](https://business-science.github.io/timetk/) for tutorials and a [complete list of function references](https://business-science.github.io/timetk/reference/index.html). 

## Package Functionality

There are _many_ R packages for working with Time Series data. Here's how `timetk` compares to the "tidy" time series R packages for data visualization, wrangling, and feature engineeering (those that leverage data frames or tibbles).

## What can you do in 1 line of code?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(timetk)
```

Investigate a time series... 

```{r, fig.height=6}
taylor_30_min %>%
    plot_time_series(date, value, .color_var = week(date), 
                     .interactive = FALSE, .color_lab = "Week")
```

Visualize anomalies...

```{r, fig.height=7}
walmart_sales_weekly %>%
    group_by(Store, Dept) %>%
    plot_anomaly_diagnostics(Date, Weekly_Sales, 
                             .facet_ncol = 3, .interactive = FALSE)
```

Make a seasonality plot...

```{r, fig.height=8}
taylor_30_min %>%
    plot_seasonal_diagnostics(date, value, .interactive = FALSE)
```

Inspect autocorrelation, partial autocorrelation (and cross correlations too)...

```{r}
taylor_30_min %>%
    plot_acf_diagnostics(date, value, .lags = "1 week", .interactive = FALSE)
```



## Acknowledgements

The `timetk` package wouldn't be possible without other amazing time series packages. 

* [stats](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/stats-package.html) - Basically every `timetk` function that uses a period (frequency) argument owes it to `ts()`. 
    - `plot_acf_diagnostics()`: Leverages `stats::acf()`, `stats::pacf()` & `stats::ccf()`
    - `plot_stl_diagnostics()`: Leverages `stats::stl()`
* [lubridate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/): `timetk` makes heavy use of `floor_date()`, `ceiling_date()`, and `duration()` for "time-based phrases". 
    - Add and Subtract Time (`%+time%` & `%-time%`): `"2012-01-01" %+time% "1 month 4 days"` uses `lubridate` to intelligently offset the day
* [xts](https://github.com/joshuaulrich/xts): Used to calculate periodicity and fast lag automation. 
* [forecast (retired)](https://pkg.robjhyndman.com/forecast/): Possibly my favorite R package of all time. It's based on `ts`, and it's predecessor is the `tidyverts` (`fable`, `tsibble`, `feasts`, and `fabletools`). 
    - The `ts_impute_vec()` function for low-level vectorized imputation using STL + Linear Interpolation uses `na.interp()` under the hood. 
    - The `ts_clean_vec()` function for low-level vectorized imputation using STL + Linear Interpolation uses `tsclean()` under the hood.
    - Box Cox transformation `auto_lambda()` uses `BoxCox.Lambda()`.  
* [tibbletime (retired)](https://business-science.github.io/tibbletime/): While `timetk` does not import `tibbletime`, it uses much of the innovative functionality to interpret time-based phrases:
    - `tk_make_timeseries()` - Extends `seq.Date()` and `seq.POSIXt()` using a simple phase like "2012-02" to populate the entire time series from start to finish in February 2012.
    - `filter_by_time()`, `between_time()` - Uses innovative endpoint detection from phrases like "2012"
    - `slidify()` is basically `rollify()` using `slider` (see below).
* [slider](https://davisvaughan.github.io/slider/): A powerful R package that provides a `purrr`-syntax for complex rolling (sliding) calculations. 
    - `slidify()` uses `slider::pslide` under the hood. 
    - `slidify_vec()` uses `slider::slide_vec()` for simple vectorized rolls (slides).
* [padr](https://edwinth.github.io/padr/): Used for padding time series from low frequency to high frequency and filling in gaps. 
    - The `pad_by_time()` function is a wrapper for `padr::pad()`.
    - See the `step_ts_pad()` to apply padding as a preprocessing recipe!
* [TSstudio](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/TSstudio): This is the best interactive time series visualization tool out there. It leverages the `ts` system, which is the same system the `forecast` R package uses. A ton of inspiration for visuals came from using `TSstudio`.
