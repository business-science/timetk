> A collection of tools for working with time series in R

Frequency and trend cycles are used in many time series applications including Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) forecasting and STL Decomposition. New in `timetk` 1.0.0 are __Automatic Frequency and Trend Selection tools.__ These tools use only the the timestamp information to make logical guesses about the frequency and trend.


# Prerequisites

Before we get started, load the following packages.

```{r, message = F, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyquant) # Used for FANG dataset
library(timetk)
```

# Data

__Daily Irregular Data__

The daily stock prices of Facebook from 2013 to 2016 (courtesy of `tidyquant`). Note that trading days only occur on "business days" (non-weekends and non-business-holidays).

```{r}
data(FANG)

FB_tbl <- FANG %>% filter(symbol == "FB")
FB_tbl
```

__Sub-Daily Data__

Taylor's Energy Demand data at a 30-minute timestamp interval. 

```{r}
taylor_30_min
```


# Applications

An example of where automatic frequency detection occurs is in the `plot_stl_diagnostics()` function. 

```{r, fig.height=8}
taylor_30_min %>%
    plot_stl_diagnostics(date, value, 
                         .frequency = "auto", .trend = "auto",
                         .interactive = FALSE)
```


# Automatic Frequency & Trend Selection

## Specifying a Frequency or Trend 

The `period` argument has three basic options for returning a frequency. Options include:

- "auto": A target frequency is determined using a pre-defined ___Time Scale Template___ (see below).
- time-based duration: (e.g. "7 days" or "2 quarters" per cycle)
- numeric number of observations: (e.g. 5 for 5 observations per cycle)

## Frequency

A _frequency_ is loosely defined as the number of observations that comprise a cycle in a data set.

Using `tk_get_frequency()`, we can pick a number of observations that will roughly define a frequency for the series. 

__Daily Irregular Data__

Because `FB_tbl` is irregular (weekends and holidays are not present), the frequency selected is weekly but each week is only 5-days typically. So 5 is selected. 

```{r, message = TRUE}
FB_tbl %>% tk_index() %>% tk_get_frequency(period = "auto")
```

__Sub-Daily Data__

This works as well for a sub-daily time series. Here we'll use `taylor_30_min` for a 30-minute timestamp series. The frequency selected is 48 because there are 48 timestamps (observations) in 1 day for the 30-minute cycle. 

```{r}
taylor_30_min %>% tk_index() %>% tk_get_frequency("1 day")
```

## Trend

The trend is loosely defined as time span that can be aggregated across to visualize the central tendency of the data.

Using `tk_get_trend()`, we can pick a number of observations that will help describe a trend for the data.

__Daily Irregular Data__

Because `FB_tbl` is irregular (weekends and holidays are not present), the trend selected is 3 months but each week is only 5-days typically. So 64 observations is selected. 

```{r, message = TRUE}
FB_tbl %>% tk_index() %>% tk_get_trend(period = "auto")
```

__Sub-Daily Data__

A 14-day (2 week) interval is selected for the "30-minute" interval data. 

```{r}
taylor_30_min %>% tk_index() %>% tk_get_trend("auto")
```



# Time Scale Template

A ___Time-Scale Template___ is used to get and set the time scale template, which is used by `tk_get_frequency()` and `tk_get_trend()` when `period = "auto"`.

The predefined template is stored in a function `tk_time_scale_template()`. This is the default used by `timetk`.

__Accessing the Default Template__

You can access the current template with `get_tk_time_scale_template()`.

```{r}
get_tk_time_scale_template()
```


__Changing the Default Template__

You can modify the current template with `set_tk_time_scale_template()`.
