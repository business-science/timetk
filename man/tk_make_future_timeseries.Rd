\arguments{
\item{idx}{A vector of dates}

\item{n_future}{Number of future observations}

\item{inspect_weekdays}{Uses a logistic regression algorithm to inspect
whether certain weekdays (e.g. weekends) should be excluded from the future dates.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{inspect_months}{Uses a logistic regression algorithm to inspect
whether certain days of months (e.g. last two weeks of year or seasonal days)
should be excluded from the future dates.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{skip_values}{A vector of same class as \code{idx} of timeseries
values to skip.}

\item{insert_values}{A vector of same class as \code{idx} of timeseries
values to insert.}
}
\value{
A vector containing future index of the same class as the incoming index \code{idx}
}

\details{
\strong{Future Sequences}

\code{tk_make_future_timeseries} returns a time series based
on the input index frequency and attributes.

The argument \code{n_future} determines how many future index observations to compute.

The \code{inspect_weekdays} and \code{inspect_months} arguments apply to "daily" (scale = "day") data
(refer to \code{tk_get_timeseries_summary()} to get the index scale).
The \code{inspect_weekdays} argument is useful in determining missing days of the week
that occur on a weekly frequency such as every week, every other week, and so on.
It's recommended to have at least 60 days to use this option.
The \code{inspect_months} argument is useful in determining missing days of the month, quarter
or year; however, the algorithm can inadvertently select incorrect dates if the pattern
is erratic.

For example, some holidays do not occur on the same day of each month, and
as a result the incorrect day may be selected in certain years.
It's recommended to always review the date results to ensure the future days match
the user's expectations. It's recommended to have at least two years of days to use
this option.

The \code{skip_values} and \code{insert_values} arguments can be used to remove and add
values into the series of future times. The values must be the same format as the \code{idx} class.
The \code{skip_values} argument useful for passing holidays or special index values that should
be excluded from the future time series.
The \code{insert_values} argument is useful for adding values back that the algorithm may have
excluded.
